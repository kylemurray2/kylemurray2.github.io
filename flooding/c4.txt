Figure 4. (a) Future sea levels at location indicated by a black and white circle in b. Solid rainbow colored lines show the sea
level each decade if subsidence is not accounted for. The dashed rainbow colored lines show the sea level each decade if
continued subsidence is accounted for (1 cm/yr of subsidence). (b) Map view colored by the decade when each pixel will be
exposed to flooding (see Fig. 3 for spatial extent of map). (c) The effect of subsidence on the timing of initial flood exposure
(the number of years flood exposure is shifted earlier in time if subsidence was not accounted for in the model). See Fig. S27
for uncertainty values for each map.
