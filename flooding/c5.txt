Figure 5. Time series showing the total area of land below sea level for the Mapunapuna area (see Figure 3 for extent of data).
The lines show the estimated area without accounting for subsidence (solid black), area accounting for subsidence (dashed
black), and the difference between the dashed and solid black lines (solid blue). The lower and upper bounds are shown with
gray shading and are based on Monte Carlo simulation using uncertainties for the DEM elevations, VLM rates, and SLR
projections (Section 4.3).
