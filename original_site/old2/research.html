    Kyle D. Murray’s graduate research has focused broadly on four themes which are all linked by the drive to push the limits of geodetic methods to more precisely measure and map how the earth is actively deforming in space and time. These themes are:
    </p>
    
    <p class="bg">
    1.	Intracontinental tectonics/continental rifting 
    </p>
    <p class="bg">
    2.	Geodetic data processing and time series analysis
    </p>
    <p class="bg">
      3.	Spatio-temporal evolution of groundwater constrained by geodetic methods
    </p>
    <p class="bg">
    4.	Atmospheric modeling for noise reduction and characterization in InSAR
    </p>

Continental Rifting
    </p>
    
    <p class="bg">
    His Master’s work focused on the slowly deforming Rio Grande Rift and Colorado Plateau. The objective of this project was to identify strain concentrations across the rift with continuous GPS measurements to better constrain rifting dynamics. This area is extending at an average rate of about 1 mm/yr, requiring special attention to data processing, noise characterization, and time series analysis methods. Among other outcomes of this project, he and his collaborators produced precise strain rate maps showing several areas of strain localizations and updated our current understanding of active deformation in the area with implications for both rift kinematics and hazards.

    Tropospheric noise in InSAR
    </p>
    
    <p class="bg">
    A major focus of Murray’s PhD dissertation is on InSAR methods and applications. This includes software development for improved InSAR time series processing to improve interferometric coherence and noise mitigation. More specifically, he has worked extensively on improving methods for characterizing and removing the tropospheric delay component in InSAR. For this he has worked with numerous datasets and modeling techniques to compare the efficacy of current methods and metrics to evaluate each method. Furthermore, he is actively working on developing machine learning-based tools to better relate external datasets to InSAR tropospheric phase delays.  These methods are being tested on anthropogenic deformation and induced seismicity in the Central US, as well as slow slip deformation in south-central Mexico.

    Groundwater/Anthropogenic related crustal deformation
    </p>
    <p class="bg">
    Murray has applied these methods to the Central Valley of California where excessive groundwater extraction has resulted in widespread large magnitude ground subsidence. He was able to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of groundwater-related deformation addressing the complex aquifer response to extraction, drought, and natural and artificial recharge. Furthermore, he is actively working on a collaborative project that combines multiple satellite look geometries to invert for 3D displacement time series constrained by elastic Green’s functions.  This is being applied to an area of groundwater entrainment in the Coachella valley which has resulted in rapid uplift bounded by active faults. This has implications for understanding of fault permeability, how the associated stresses are acting on nearby faults, and aquifer properties.
