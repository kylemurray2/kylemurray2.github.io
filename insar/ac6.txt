Fig. 6. (a) and (b) Ascending (June 8, 2015–July 2, 2015) and descending (November 8, 2015–March 16, 2019). (c) and (d) Profiles [from white lines in maps
(b) and (d)] of negative and positive synthetic Gaussian signals (black line), the synthetic signal added to the ascending interferogram (blue line), the same
interferogram after applying a uniform phase-elevation dependence correction (orange line), and the interferogram after applying a six-cluster phase-elevation
dependence correction (green line). Elevation across the same profile is also plotted (brown line) with a scale bar on the right y-axis.
