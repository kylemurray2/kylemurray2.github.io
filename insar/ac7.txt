Fig. 7. Average linear rate maps with respect to mean of nondeforming
areas (a) before and (c) after phase-elevation dependence correction for
ascending path. Standard deviation of residual from linear rate at to each
pixel (b) before and (d) after phase-elevation dependence correction. Time
series consists of 104 dates spanning the time range November 23, 2015â€“
March 19, 2019 with no redundant interferometric pairs. Black triangles in
(a) correspond to GPS stations in Fig. 8.
