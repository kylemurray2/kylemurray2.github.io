Fig. 5. (a) Total rms for 40 ascending interferograms from south-central
Mexico versus the number of K -means clusters used in the correction. Zero
clusters corresponds to the original interferogram with no correction applied,
and one cluster is equivalent to the uniform phase-elevation dependence
correction with no spatial variability. The black line is the mean rms of all
40 interferograms. (b) Averaged semivariogram for 40 interferograms before
and after phase-elevation dependence correction with and without cluster
analysis. Shaded colored regions indicate 95% confidence, based on the
variation within the ensemble of interferograms. The semivariograms from
corrected interferograms using the windowing approach and the GACOS
model are shown for comparison (pink and light blue).
