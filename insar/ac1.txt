Fig. 1. Example showing phase and elevation variability in two distinct areas for the interferogram pair June 8, 2015-July 2, 2015. (a) Ascending interferogram with blue and orange rectangles encompassing pixels plotted as blue and orange in panel (c). (c) Spatial variability of phase-elevation dependence. (b) Footprints of ascending (red, track 78) and descending (green, track 41) Sentinel-1 tracks used in this study.
