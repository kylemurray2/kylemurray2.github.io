Fig. 7. Central US results: Statistical metrics as a function of distance for example interferogram (07/17/2016â€“07/29/2016) before and after applying corrections
(left column) and the same metrics averaged over 60 interferograms made from 61 dates (right column). Average standard deviation as a function of the size of a
square window of pixels (row 1), spectral characteristics (row 2), and semivariograms (row 3) for each correction type. GPS results were excluded from averaged
metrics (right column) due to variability in data availability throughout the date range.
