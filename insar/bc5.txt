Fig. 5. Central US Example: Interferogram (upper left) for date pair 07/17/2016â€“07/29/2016, modeled tropospheric delays using various independent datasets (1st row), corrected interferogram for each correction type (2nd row), and histograms for each corrected interferogram (3rd row). Column headings are grouped by weather models (red), phase-elevation dependence (yellow), GNSS (blue), and precipitable water vapor data (green).
