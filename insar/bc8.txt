Fig. 8. Mexico results: Statistical metrics as a function of distance for example interferogram (3/5/2017â€“3/17/2017) before and after applying corrections (left column) and the same metrics averaged over 60 interferograms made from 61 dates (right column). Average standard deviation as a function of the size of a square window of pixels (row 1), spectral characteristics (row 2), and semivariograms (row 3) for each correction type.
