Fig. 8. Average linear rate maps (a) before and (c) after phase-elevation
dependence correction for descending path. Standard deviation of residual
from linear rate at to each pixel (b) before and (d) after phase-elevation
dependence correction. Rate map was computed with a subset of 56 inter-
ferograms spanning the time range November 8, 2015â€“March 16, 2019 with
no redundant pairs to approximate the time span of the ascending track for
comparison.
