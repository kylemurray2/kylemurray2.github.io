Fig. 5. Year-to-year differences in subsidence behavior. (A) Time series at two representative points as a function of the day of year for each of the three years, beginning on the date of the first available SAR acquisition (November 8; day of year,âˆ’53). Locations of examples 1 and 4 are the same as in Fig. 3 and are shown in map view in (B) and (C). Cumulative difference of first and second years (B) and second and third years (C) at each pixel, averaged over shaded time period shown in (A). Map symbols are the same as in Fig. 1. Differences less than 2 cm are trans- parent. This analysis assumes no model (for example Eq. 1) to characterize the data but still illustrates the spatial and temporal variability in subsidence, indicat- ing that the effects that we observe are not just an artifact of the time period used in fitting Eq. 1.
