Figure 7. Inversions of synthetic data for 3-D surface velocity for the undamped, damped, and coupled cases. Curves are colored by noise level standard deviation (upto   1) added to the synthetic line-of-sight images. Black dashed lines are the “true” velocities associated with the buried dislocation. Units are arbitrary, but are chosen to approximate the 10 cm/yr line-of-sight (LOS) signals observed for the Whitewater basin data. Scales on Y-axis for the Y-velocities are allowed to vary between panels to emphasize the magnitude of variability associated with the various approaches.
