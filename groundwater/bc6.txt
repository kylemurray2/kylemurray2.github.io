Figure 6. Line-of-sight geometries for the four satellite tracks swaths used in this study in cross section (a) and map
view (b), with satellite azimuth direction and incidence angle. Solid lines indicate look vectors for ascending (north-
northwest traveling) and descending (south-southwest traveling) tracks (dashed lines). Line colors correspond to colors
of footprints in Figure 1.
