imagery from the Sentinel-1a/b satellites (November 2014 to October 2017) illuminates secular and seasonal
trends modulated by changes in withdrawal rates and the magnitude of winter precipitation. Despite the increased
precipitation in early 2017 that led to a marked decrease, or in some areas, reversal, of subsidence rates, subsidence
returned to rates observed during the drought within a matter of months.
