Fig. 2. Temporal variability of ground deformation. Displacement history at location of GPS station CRCN (Fig. 1) for Sentinel-1 (red dots) and GPS (black dots) projected into Sentinel-1 LOS (~38° from vertical), and best-fit model of secular + seasonal signal (green line), with daily stream discharge (light blue curve) at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) monitoring site at Deer Creek (https://waterdata.usgs.gov). The light gray–shaded area indicates the approximate time range of drought in California, with purple shading highlighting the rate changes that began in early 2017. We use GPS position solutions in the NA12 reference frame, available for download on the data products pages of the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (http://geodesy.unr.edu).
