Figure 9. Results from inversion of multiple line-of-sight (LOS) values for X, Y, and Z velocity (Rows 1, 2, and 3, respectively). The time period is approximately from 02/2017–12/2017. Values are saturated outside of the range −6–+6 cm/yr for horizontal velocities and −9 – +9 cm/yr for vertical velocities. (Column 1) Inversion of data from three Sentinel-1 tracks and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) with no damping. (Column 2) Inversion of only Sentinel-1 data with damping of the Y term. (Column 3) Inversion of only Sentinel-1 data with the elastically coupled inversion method. Red line in panel (a) indicates location of cross section in Figure 10. UCERF model has been removed from each component prior to each inversion to reduce the contribution from large-scale tectonic signals.
