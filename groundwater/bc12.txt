Figure 12. SW-NE fault-parallel (a–c) and fault-perpendicular (d–f) velocity profiles from Figure 11 relative to the Garnet Hill fault along with their respective gradients (g–i, right-lateral sense of strain is positive, (j–l), compression across the fault is negative). Profiles from damped, Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), and coupled inversions are shown for comparison. Location of the Garnet Hill fault is indicated by vertical black dashed lines in each panel. Damped and UAVSAR were filtered with a 6 pixel (0.25 km) moving average to match the additional smoothing necessary to implement the coupled inversion. Interseismic motion has been removed using the UCERF model.
