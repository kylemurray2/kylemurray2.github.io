Figure 5. GPS velocities (black vectors) in the NA12 reference frame, available from the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory
(http://geodesy.unr.edu). Color scale is UCERF-3: interpolated GPS east velocities (a) and north velocities (b) (Parsons
et al., 2013). These velocities were used to subtract motion associated with the plate boundary from Interferometric
Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR)-derived displacements.
