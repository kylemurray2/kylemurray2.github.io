Figure 3. Observed displacement rates during 2017 for the five independent Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) datasets. Positive values indicate displacement toward the satellite. Decorrelated areas and high elevation areas (500 m) have been masked out and are not used in our analysis. The Whitewater groundwater replenishment facility percolation grounds are roughly outlined in red and the USGS well 03S04E20F01S (https://waterdata.usgs. gov/nwis/gw) is labeled in panel (a) (black triangle). Faults from the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Community Fault Model are shown as white lines. The approximate extent of each panel is outlined by the white box in Figure 1. Rates are constructed using 18 acquisitions from the date range 02/26/2017–11/29/2017 (a), 29 acquisitions from 02/21/2017–12/06/2017 (b), 17 acquisitions from 03/04/2017–12/05/2017 (c), 13 acquisitions from 05/10/2017– 12/12/2017 (d), and two acquisitions from 04/04/2017–09/28/2017 (e).
