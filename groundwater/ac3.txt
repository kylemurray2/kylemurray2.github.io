Fig. 3. Displacement profiles and time series reference area. (A and B) Profiles of cumulative displacements colored by acquisition time [profile location in (C)].
Every fifth date is plotted. (A) Cumulative displacements after removing a planar function and mean offset from each date. Note that the large region of subsidence has
biased this estimate, resulting in an artificial signal of apparent uplift along the margins, particularly near point P. (B) Cumulative displacements after removing mean
offset calculated on the basis of subset of pixels defined by SD criterion. (C) SD of time series at each pixel after applying a low-pass filter (allowing only periods greater
than 180 days). The black contour line (10 cm) represents the threshold SD used to separate deforming areas from nondeforming areas in offset correction. Nondeforming
areas were used as reference pixels in the displacement time series. Note that even some of the smaller subsidence features associated with hydrocarbon extraction in the
southwest are automatically identified using our approach.
