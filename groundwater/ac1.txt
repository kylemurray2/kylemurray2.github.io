Fig. 1. Subsidence rates and seasonal amplitudes. (A) Secular rates of displacement in the satelliteâ€™s line of sight (LOS) inferred from 40 Sentinel-1 acquisitions
(November 2014 to November 2016), as well as the Corcoran clay extent (gray, white outline), rivers (black lines, dotted where inferred), major canals (black dashed
lines), and faults (49) (red lines). Inset indicates location of (A) and (B) (red square), Tulare Basin (blue), and Corcoran clay extent (gray). (B) Amplitude of best-fit
sinusoidal term. SAF, San Andreas Fault.
