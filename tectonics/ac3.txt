Figure 3. (a) Horizontal rates with 90% confidence error ellipses. East‐west
dashed lines labeled 1–5 are profiles shown in Figures 5 and 6. Vectors in red
have been omitted from the analysis. (b) Vertical rates are shown in color
scale (blue is subsidence, and red is uplift). The size of circles represents the
vertical rate uncertainty (larger circles have lower uncertainty). Sites that
were omitted from the analysis are also shown. (a and b) Colorado Plateau
(CP) is outlined in blue, major Quaternary faults shown as red lines, late
Neogene volcanics (Jemez lineament) shown in orange, and RGR basins
shown in dark gray. SMB denotes location of the Socorro Magma Body.
