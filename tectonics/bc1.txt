Fig. 1. Study area showing the Western rift (WR) and Eastern rift (ER) that formed around the unusually thick lithosphere of the Tanzania craton (yellow shaded region). White rectangles show locations of ascending Sentinel-1a/b paths used in this study. GNSS velocity field (vectors; King et al., 2019; Knappe et al., 2020) show general eastward velocity increase as the Nubia plate separates from the Somalia plate. Teleseismically detected earthquakes from 1976 to 2021 from NEIC (blue circles), Holocene volcanoes (orange triangles; Venzke, 2013), and faults (red lines (Ebinger et al., 2024)) are shown. GNSS sites are referenced to the stable African (Nubian) plate and span variable time ranges from 2002 to 2022. Nubian (Nub), Victorian (Vic), and Somalian (Som) plates are labeled.
