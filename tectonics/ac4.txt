Figure 4. Rate map of the Socorro Magma Body (SMB) located in central New Mexico with horizontal rate vectors and 90% confidence ellipses, and vertical rates in color scale (blue is subsidence, and red is uplift). The dashed red line shows the outline of the Socorro Seismic Anomaly (SSA) as defined by Balch et al. (1997). Quaternary faults shown as white lines, late Neogene volcanics shown in orange, and RGR basins shown in dark gray.
