Figure 7. Strain rate maps with Colorado Plateau outlined in brown. (a) First invariant of the strain rate tensor (dilata-
tion). (b) First eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor (maximum extension). (c) Difference between maximum and mini-
mum principal strain rates (maximum shear strain rate). Color bar for panel (c) also applies to panels (a) and (b). (d, e) N‐
sigmas corresponding to (a), (b), and (c) respectively. 2‐sigma contours are plotted in black. N‐sigma values greater than 2
are above the 95% confidence level.
